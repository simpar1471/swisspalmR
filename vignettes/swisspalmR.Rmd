# Getting started with swisspalmR
The purpose of the swisspalmR package is to make data from SwissPalm, a database
on protein *S*-palmitoylation more accessible to R users. This is achieved by
using [httr2](https://httr2.r-lib.org/) to mimic the HTTP requests usually sent
by a browser to SwissPalm. Check out the vignette on implementation details for
more information.

## The SwissPalm website
SwissPalm data is easily accessed through web browsers, with a simple interface.
Users may perform several actions:

* Use the central text bar and 'Search' button to get palmitoylation data for a
  few protein/gene names, separated by commas
* Use the 'Batch search' button to upload a file with many gene identifiers at
  once
* Use the 'Palmitoyl-proteome comparison' button to perform check a user's
  protein/gene list against published palmitoyl-proteomes for a variety of
  species.

The header bar contains even more options, which you can check out yourself
below:
```{r sp_homepage, out.width = '100%', echo = FALSE}
# knitr::include_graphics(file.path("img", "swisspalm_home.png"))
knitr::include_url("https://swisspalm.org/")
```

The SwissPalm database is an excellent source of information for researchers
interested in *S*-palmitoylation, but the database has not been made easily
accessible before in R. The swisspalmR package resolves this by making the same
HTTP requests used by the SwissPalm website to send and then retrieve
*S*-palmitoylation data in web browsers.

## Using swisspalmR
To use swisspalmR, install the package from GitHub.
```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("simpar1471/swisspalmR")
```

At present, swisspalmR has one function, `swissPalm()`, which can retrieve the
protein-level information on *S*-palmitoylation which is usually accessible from
https://www.swisspalm.org/proteins. This function returns a 25-column data frame
with protein information (if available) which includes:

* Which organism the queried gene/protein ID is from
* Whether the protein/gene associated with a queried ID is reviewed in UniProt
* Whether the protein is palmitolyated, and if so:
  * At which residues palmitoylation occurs
  * The number of cysteine residues
  * Which other PATs/APTs palmitoylate/depalmitoylate the queried protein

This information and other information from `swissPalm()` is useful for
determining the pattern of palmitoylation in your own samples.

To get data on *S*-palmitoylation irrespective of any other factors, provide
a character vector of protein identifiers to `swissPalm()`. These identifiers
should be in one of the formats in the dropdown menu below:

<details>
  <summary>Valid formats</summary>

* UniProt AC
* UniProt secondary AC
* UniProt ID
* UniProt gene name
* Ensembl protein
* Ensembl gene
* Refseq protein ID
* IPI ID
* UniGene ID
* PomBase ID
* MGI ID
* RGD ID
* TAIR protein ID
* EuPathDb ID
</details>

Let's say you have a UniProt accession, a UniProt ID, and an Ensembl ID. As
SwissPalm recognises all of these, `swissPalm()` will give you information on
each. Where a single gene name (e.g. `"CALML5"`) maps onto multiple proteins,
each of these proteins will have their own row.
```{r swissPalm_fine_IDs, error = FALSE}
inputs <- c("Q4WCM2", "ENSP00000453745", "CALML5")
# Include only first five columns to restrict printed output
swissPalm(inputs)[, 1:5]
```

Any query identifiers not found in SwissPalm will have `NA` in most columns, but
the `Found_in_SwissPalm` column will tell you why they were not found in the
SwissPalm search:
```{r swissPalm_badids}
inputs <- c("Q4WCM2", "BAD_ID")
swissPalm(inputs)[, 1:5]
```

## Limiting your searches
Sometimes, you may want to limit the search space to only the species against
which you are checking, or to only check for data from specific sources. The
`species` and `dataset` parameters in `swissPalm()` let you do this.

You can check the package objects `swisspalmR::species` or
`swisspalmR::datasets` to see what the available `species`/`dataset` parameter
values are:
```{r check_species_dataset}
# There are 92 species available as of Sep 12th 2023
swisspalmR::species[1:5]
# There are 7 datasets available as of Sep 12th 2023
swisspalmR::datasets
```

For example, a gene name can be shared by many species. I could filter the
results of a SwissPalm search down to a species of interest, such as horses,
by telling `swissPalm()` I want only that data:
```{r swissPalm_horses}
gene_names <- c("ADAMTS1", "AGL", "ANGPTL4", "CALML5", "CEP131", "CD70", "CD97")
swissPalm(gene_names, species = swisspalmR::species["Equus caballus"])[, 1:5]
```

I can also further limit SwissPalm to only giving me information when proteins
were predicted to be *S*-palmitoylated using the `dataset` parameter:
```{r swissPalm_horses_palmpred}
gene_names <- c("ADAMTS1", "AGL", "ANGPTL4", "CALML5", "CEP131", "CD70", "CD97")
swissPalm(
  gene_names,
  species = swisspalmR::species["Equus caballus"],
  dataset = swisspalmR::datasets["Dataset 2: Proteins predicted to be palmitoylated"]
)[, 1:5]
```
