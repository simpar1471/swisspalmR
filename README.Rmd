swisspalmR is a small package with one purpose: retrieval of S-palmitoylation
data from the SwissPalm database using `httr2`, `rvest` and `curl`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of swisspalmR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("simpar1471/swisspalmR")
```

## Examples

To query the SwissPalm database, get some protein accessions into a vector. The
proteins must be supported by SwissPalm, i.e. a UniProt AC,
UniProt secondary AC, UniProt ID, UniProt gene name, Ensembl protein,
Ensembl gene, Refseq protein ID, IPI ID, UniGene ID, PomBase ID, MGI ID,
RGD ID, TAIR protein ID, or EuPathDb ID.

Once in a vector you can query the SwissPalm database using the `swissPalm()`
function. You'll receive a 25-column dataframe with rows for each query ID
supplied to the function, detailing various aspects of S-palmitoylation for
each protein found in SwissPalm. For example:

```{r example_spalm1}
protein_ids <- c("P05067", "O00161", "P04899", "P98019")
# Only using 5 cols to restrict printed output
swisspalmR::swissPalm(protein_ids)[, c(1, 3, 4, 23, 24)]
```

You can test your protein accessions against specific datasets or species in
SwissPalm using the `dataset` and `species` parameters. Valid values for
`dataset` and `species` can be found in the package objects
`swisspalmR::datasets` and `swisspalmR::species`.

```{r example_spalm2}
# Checking against only mallard ducks
mallard <- swisspalmR::species["Mallard duck"]
swisspalmR::swissPalm(protein_ids, species = mallard)[, c(1, 3, 4, 23, 24)]
```

More information on using `swissPalm()` can be found in the [introductory
vignette](https://simpar1471.github.io/swisspalmR/articles/swisspalmR.html).

Note that `swissPalm()` is [memoised](https://memoise.r-lib.org/index.html) -
results are cached and returned if the same inputs are provided to `swissPalm()`
in one session. This way, SwissPalm can return results to users faster. If you
want the `swissPalm()` function to 'forget' previous results, use
`memoise::forget(swissPalm)`.

## Planned features

Though `swissPalm()` is memoised, the function will request data it has already
received from SwissPalm if provided in a different vector, or if different
`species`/`dataset` parameters are used.

```r
swissPalm(query_id = "P05067")
swissPalm(query_id = "P05067", species = "7")
swissPalm(query_id = c("P05067", "P04899"))
```

In the above calls, data for `"P05067"` is requested from SwissPalm three times
even though SwissPalm is memoised. I plan to implement a caching system
separate from `memoise` which cache `swissPalm()` outputs in memory. These could
be retrieved when necessary to further reduce the load on the SwissPalm
database.

Additionally, the SwissPalm database has more than just the
[protein-level data](https://swisspalm.org/proteins) accessed by `swissPalm()`.
This includes data on
[hits/sites](https://swisspalm.org/hits) and
[experiments](https://swisspalm.org/experiments). I plan to extend swisspalmR
for accessing this data.
